# Revolutionizing Agriculture with AI

Welcome to the Revolutionizing Agriculture with AI project! This repository integrates computer vision and image processing techniques using Azure Custom Vision to transform farming practices. By deploying drones equipped with advanced algorithms, we accurately identify planted paddies and precisely target weed-infested areas for fertilization. This innovative solution optimizes crop management, enhancing yield while minimizing environmental impact.

## Features

- **Computer Vision Integration:** Utilize Azure Custom Vision for accurate identification of planted paddies and weed-infested areas.
- **Drones Deployment:** Deploy drones equipped with advanced algorithms for efficient aerial monitoring.
- **Precision Fertilization:** Target weed-infested areas for fertilization, optimizing crop management practices.
- **Environmental Impact Reduction:** Minimize environmental impact by reducing the use of fertilizers and pesticides.
- **Sustainable Agriculture:** Contribute to the future of sustainable agriculture through innovative technologies.
